3D Transformations: SE(3)
=========================

The group of all transformations in the 3D Cartesian space is :math:`SE(3)`.
Transformations consist of a rotation and a translation. Those can be
represented in multiple different ways. One of the most convenient ways
to represent transformations are transformation matrices.
